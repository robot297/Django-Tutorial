# Django Tutorial
Sample tutorial on how to get a Django site up and running.

This is based off of Django's [documentation.](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/)

I use pipenv for dependency management.

To follow along, look at the [previous merge requests](https://github.com/robot297/Django-Tutorial/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) that document the changes.
